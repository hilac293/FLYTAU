FlyTau – Flight Booking & Management System

FlyTau is a full-stack flight booking system that simulates the core functionality of an airline platform.  
The project is divided into two main parts: **Customer Area** and **Management Area**.

---

Customer Area
Customers can:
- Search for available flights  
- Choose seats (Economy / Business class)  
- Create and manage flight orders  
- View booking summary and total price  
- Complete the booking process  

This part focuses on user experience and smooth flight reservation flow.

---

Management Area
Managers can:
- Add new flights to the system  
- Update flight details  
- Monitor existing flights  
- View management reports and statistics  
- Manage system data efficiently  

This area is designed for administrative control and decision-making support.

Technologies
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Database: MySQL
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Jinja2
- Authentication & Sessions
- Relational database design with full constraints (PK, FK)

---

Project Goals
- Simulate a real airline reservation system  
- Practice database design and normalization  
- Combine backend logic with frontend interface  
- Implement a management control panel  
- Work with secure data handling and structured SQL schemas  

---

Notes
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment and demonstrates:
- Full database schema design  
- Separation between customer and administrator roles  
- Clean system architecture
